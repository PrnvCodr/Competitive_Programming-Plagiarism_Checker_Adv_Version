================================================================================

in competitive programming submissions.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

1. CORE COMPONENTS
------------------
- Main Application: app.py (Single file Streamlit application)
- Detection Engine: CompetitiveProgrammingPlagiarismDetector class
- Visualization Module: Plotly/Matplotlib integration
- Export System: Multi-format report generation

2. ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION
---------------------------
The system implements 12 distinct plagiarism detection algorithms:

A) Advanced MOSS (Mock):
   - Combines winnowing fingerprinting with token analysis
   - Normalizes variables to detect renaming
   - Analyzes control flow patterns
   - Weighted similarity calculation (30% fingerprints, 25% tokens, 20% control flow, 25% structure)

B) Token Frequency Analysis:
   - Tokenizes C++ code using regex patterns
   - Counts frequency of keywords, operators, identifiers
   - Uses intersection over union for similarity

C) Structure-based Comparison:
   - Counts structural elements (if, for, while, functions, brackets)
   - Calculates cosine similarity of element vectors
   - Focuses on algorithmic structure rather than syntax

D) Winnowing Fingerprinting:
   - Generates k-grams (default k=7) from token sequences
   - Creates rolling hash fingerprints
   - Selects minimum hash in sliding windows (w=5)
   - Compares fingerprint intersection/union ratio

E) Edit Distance (Levenshtein):
   - Dynamic programming approach for character-level differences
   - Preprocesses code to remove comments and normalize whitespace
   - Returns normalized similarity (1 - distance/max_length)

F) Longest Common Subsequence:
   - Finds longest common subsequence between token streams
   - Uses dynamic programming with O(m*n) complexity
   - Normalizes by maximum sequence length

G) Jaccard Similarity:
   - Set-based similarity on unique tokens
   - Formula: |intersection| / |union|
   - Effective for detecting copied code blocks

H) Cosine Similarity:
   - TF-IDF vectorization of preprocessed code
   - Calculates cosine angle between document vectors
   - Handles variable-length documents effectively

I) N-Gram Analysis:
   - Creates n-grams (default n=3) from token sequences
   - Compares n-gram sets using Jaccard similarity
   - Detects local code patterns

J) Control Flow Analysis:
   - Extracts control structures with position information
   - Compares sequence of control flow elements
   - Detects algorithmic similarity independent of variable names

K) Variable Renaming Detection:
   - Normalizes variable names to generic identifiers (var0, var1, etc.)
   - Compares normalized code structures
   - Specifically targets obfuscation attempts

L) Comment Removal Analysis:
   - Compares original vs comment-stripped versions
   - Returns maximum similarity to detect comment-based hiding
   - Focuses on actual code logic

3. PREPROCESSING PIPELINE
-------------------------
Each algorithm uses a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline:

Stage 1: Comment Removal
- Single-line comments (//.*)
- Multi-line comments (/* ... */)
- Python-style comments for mixed code

Stage 2: String Literal Normalization
- Replaces string contents with generic placeholders
- Preserves string structure while removing content differences

Stage 3: Whitespace Normalization
- Converts multiple whitespace to single spaces
- Removes leading/trailing whitespace
- Standardizes formatting differences

Stage 4: Tokenization
- C++ keyword extraction
- Operator and delimiter identification
- Identifier and literal recognition
- Case normalization

4. SIMILARITY CALCULATION ENGINE
